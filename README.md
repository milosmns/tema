Text Manipulator (TEMA) helps you... well, manipulate text. üòÉ

Its main purpose is to serve as a working Kotlin/Native showcase app.

TEMA supports some basic operations like

- Reversing text
    - `"I want an apple."` becomes `".elppa na tnaw I"`
- Flipping text
    - `"I want an apple."` becomes `"I  ç…êu á …êu …êddl«ùÀô"`
- and so on...

To use the tool and see all of its options, you need a TEMA binary on your device.
There's a bunch of binaries [in the releases section](https://github.com/milosmns/tema/releases), 
but you can also build TEMA on your own.


### üõ†Ô∏è Building

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd tema
./gradlew build
```

That's pretty much it. Kotlin/Native libs will be pulled, and your tool will be in `build/bin/native/`, built for your OS.


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running TEMA

TEMA can be run from the command line.

```bash
tema <operation> [modifiers] <content>
```

For help, simply run

```bash
tema --help
```
